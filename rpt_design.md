## Algo for won lost games
An algorithm to determine whether a game of Padel has been won or lost:

Determine the game score for each team. A game of Padel is won by the team that scores the most points, with a minimum of 6 points and a 2-point advantage over the opposing team.

If the score of either team is less than 6 points, the game is not yet over.

If the score of both teams is at least 6 points, compare the scores to determine which team has a 2-point advantage. If one team has a 2-point advantage, that team wins the game.

If neither team has a 2-point advantage, continue playing until one team gains a 2-point advantage and wins the game.

If the score of both teams is tied at 6 points or higher, continue playing until one team gains a 2-point advantage and wins the game.

If the score of either team is 10 points or higher, the game is won by the team that has the highest score at that point, with a 2-point advantage.

If the game is won by a team, the score is recorded and the game is over.

If the game is not won by either team after a maximum of 13 points, the game is considered a tie or a draw.

___

## Algorithm implementation

```
// padel-game.js

function determineGameResult(team1Score, team2Score) {
  // Determine if the game is over
  if (team1Score < 6 && team2Score < 6) {
    return null; // Game is not yet over
  }

  // Determine which team has a 2-point advantage
  const scoreDifference = Math.abs(team1Score - team2Score);
  if (scoreDifference < 2) {
    return null; // Game is not yet over
  }

  if (team1Score >= 10 || team2Score >= 10) {
    // If either team has at least 10 points, the game is won by the team with the highest score
    if (team1Score > team2Score) {
      return 1; // Team 1 wins
    } else if (team2Score > team1Score) {
      return 2; // Team 2 wins
    }
  } else {
    // If both teams have at least 6 points, the game is won by the team with a 2-point advantage
    if (team1Score > team2Score && scoreDifference >= 2) {
      return 1; // Team 1 wins
    } else if (team2Score > team1Score && scoreDifference >= 2) {
      return 2; // Team 2 wins
    }
  }

  return null; // Game is not yet over
}

module.exports = {
  determineGameResult,
};

```

This module exports a determineGameResult function that takes two arguments: team1Score and team2Score, representing the score of each team. The function returns 1 if team 1 wins, 2 if team 2 wins, and null if the game is not yet over.

# Competition Algo

below is an algorithm to classify the teams in a Padel competition with group stage:

1. Create a list of all the teams participating in the competition.

2. Divide the teams into groups. The number of groups and the number of teams in each group depend on the format of the competition.

3. For each group, create a round-robin schedule where each team plays against every other team in the group once.

4. After all games in the group have been played, calculate the points earned by each team. The number of points awarded for a win, tie, or loss also depends on the format of the competition.

5. Determine the ranking of the teams in the group based on the number of points earned. In case of a tie between two or more teams, use tiebreakers such as head-to-head record, goal difference, or goals scored to determine the ranking.

6. Take the top teams from each group and advance them to the knockout stage of the competition. Again, the number of teams and the format of the knockout stage depend on the format of the competition.

7. Continue playing knockout games until the final, where the winner of the competition is determined.

8. If there are multiple teams in a knockout game, follow the same tiebreaker rules to determine the winner.

9. At the end of the competition, rank all the teams based on their performance and award prizes or accolades accordingly.

That's a high-level algorithm for how to classify teams in a Padel competition with group stage. The details of how to implement each step will depend on the specific rules and format of the competition.

// Define the number of teams and the number of groups

## 2. function group stage

The groupStage function takes an array of team objects and returns an object containing an array of groups and a sorted array of all teams across all groups. The function first splits the teams into groups of 4 and then plays matches in each group, updating each team's points, won games, and lost games accordingly. The teams within each group are then sorted by points, won games, and lost games. Finally, all teams across all groups are sorted by the same criteria. The playMatch function is a helper function that generates a random score for a match between two teams.

````
function groupStage(teams) {
  const groupSize = 4; // number of teams in each group
  const groups = [];
  
  // split teams into groups
  for (let i = 0; i < teams.length; i += groupSize) {
    groups.push(teams.slice(i, i + groupSize));
  }
  
  // play matches in each group
  for (let i = 0; i < groups.length; i++) {
    const group = groups[i];
    const matches = [];
    
    // create a schedule of matches
    for (let j = 0; j < groupSize - 1; j++) {
      for (let k = j + 1; k < groupSize; k++) {
        matches.push([group[j], group[k]]);
      }
    }
    
    // play the matches and update team scores
    for (let j = 0; j < matches.length; j++) {
      const match = matches[j];
      const score1 = playMatch(match[0], match[1]);
      const score2 = [score1[1], score1[0]]; // reverse score for second team
      match[0].points += score1[0];
      match[0].wonGames += score1[0] > score1[1] ? 1 : 0;
      match[0].lostGames += score1[0] < score1[1] ? 1 : 0;
      match[1].points += score2[0];
      match[1].wonGames += score2[0] > score2[1] ? 1 : 0;
      match[1].lostGames += score2[0] < score2[1] ? 1 : 0;
    }
    
    // sort teams by points and won games
    group.sort((a, b) => {
      if (a.points !== b.points) {
        return b.points - a.points;
      } else if (a.wonGames !== b.wonGames) {
        return b.wonGames - a.wonGames;
      } else {
        return b.lostGames - a.lostGames;
      }
    });

## 3. creates a round-robin schedule
For each group, create a round-robin schedule where each team plays against every other team in the group once.

__ASK:__

    write a JavaScript function that takes each group from the competition, creates a round-robin schedule where each team plays against every other team in the group once.

`````
function createRoundRobinSchedule(group) {
  const numTeams = group.length;
  const numRounds = numTeams - 1;
  const half = Math.floor(numTeams / 2);

  const schedule = [];

  for (let round = 0; round < numRounds; round++) {
    const homeTeams = group.slice(0, half);
    const awayTeams = group.slice(half, numTeams).reverse();

    const roundSchedule = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < homeTeams.length; i++) {
      roundSchedule.push({
        home: homeTeams[i],
        away: awayTeams[i]
      });
    }

    schedule.push(roundSchedule);

    group.splice(1, 0, group.pop());
  }

  return schedule;
}

`````

This function takes a group array as input and returns a two-dimensional array representing the schedule for that group. Each inner array represents a round of the schedule, and each object within an inner array represents a game, with a home property and an away property indicating which teams are playing against each other.

The function first calculates the number of teams in the group and the number of rounds in the schedule. It then initializes an empty array to hold the schedule.

For each round of the schedule, the function divides the group into two halves, with the first half representing the home teams and the second half representing the away teams. It then creates an empty array to hold the games for the round.

For each game in the round, the function adds an object to the roundSchedule array with the home and away properties set to the respective teams.

After all games have been added to the round, the function adds the roundSchedule array to the schedule array and rotates the teams in the group to create the next round of the schedule.

Finally, the function returns the schedule array representing the complete round-robin schedule for the group.

___

## 4. calculate the points earned by each team.

4. After all games in the group have been played, calculate the points earned by each team. The number of points awarded for a win, tie, or loss also depends on the format of the competition.

__ASK:__
write a JavaScript function that calculates the points earned by each team in a Padel group competition. The number of points awarded for a win, tie, or loss are similar to a tennis double competition.


`````

function calculateGameScore(score) {
  // Implement your game score calculation logic here
}

`````
This function takes the schedule array generated by the createRoundRobinSchedule function, as well as the number of points to award for a win, tie, and loss.

It first initializes an empty points object to hold the points earned by each team.

It then iterates over each game in the schedule, extracting the home and away teams, the game score, and calculating the game score by calling a calculateGameScore function (which you would need to implement based on your specific game rules).

For each game, the function checks whether the home and away teams already have entries in the points object. If not, it initializes them with zero wins, ties, losses, and points.

The function then compares the game score to determine which team won or if it was a tie. It updates the win, tie, loss, and points values for the home and away teams accordingly.

Finally, the function returns the points object containing the total points earned by each team in the group stage.

## 6. top teams from each group advance to the knockout stage of the competition

6. Take the top teams from each group and advance them to the knockout stage of the competition. Again, the number of teams and the format of the knockout stage depend on the format of the competition.

__ASK:__
write a JavaScript function that takes the top teams from each of 5 groups and advance them to the knockout stage of the competition. The format of the knockout stage is similar to a Padel game and similar to a tennis double competition

 */
function calculateKnockoutStage(groups, numKnockoutTeams) {
  // Sort each group by the number of points earned by each team
  const sortedGroups = groups.map(group =>
    group.sort((team1, team2) => team2.points - team1.points)
  );

  // Extract the top teams from each group
  const topTeams = sortedGroups.map(group => group.slice(0, numKnockoutTeams));

  // Calculate the number of knockout stage rounds
  const numRounds = Math.ceil(Math.log2(topTeams.length));

  // Initialize the knockout stage array with an empty array for each round
  const knockoutStage = Array.from({ length: numRounds }, () => []);

  // Flatten the top teams array and shuffle them randomly

    knockoutStage[currentNode].push(team);
    currentNode = Math.floor(currentNode / 2) + numKnockoutTeams;
  }

  // Return the knockout stage array
  return knockoutStage;
}
`````

This function takes an array of groups, where each group is an array of team objects with properties such as name, points, goalsFor, goalsAgainst, etc. It also takes the number of teams that advance to the knockout stage, which is typically 16 or 32.

The function first sorts each group by the number of points earned by each team, in descending order. It then extracts the top teams from each group and flattens them into a single array, which is shuffled randomly.

The function then distributes the teams into the knockout stage rounds using a binary tree algorithm. It initializes the knockout stage array with an empty array for each round and starts at the root node of the binary tree. It then adds each team to the current node and moves to the next node according to the binary tree rules. Once all the teams have been distributed, the function returns the knockout stage array, which is an array of knockout stage rounds, where each round is an array of team objects.

Here's an example of how you could use this function:

__USE:__

````
// Define an array of groups, where each group is an array of team objects
const groups = [
  [
    { name: 'Team 1', points: 6, goalsFor: 8, goalsAgainst: 4 },
    { name: 'Team 2', points: 4, goalsFor: 6, goalsAgainst: 4 },
    { name: 'Team 3', points: 4, goalsFor: 4, goalsAgainst: 4 },
    { name: 'Team 4', points: 2, goalsFor: 2, goalsAgainst: 6 },
  ];

// Assume we have an array of 25 teams, each with their own statistics
const teams = [
  { name: "Team 1", points: 15, goalsFor: 20, goalsAgainst: 10 },
  { name: "Team 2", points: 12, goalsFor: 18, goalsAgainst: 12 },
  // ... and so on for the other 23 teams
];

// Call the calculateKnockoutStage function with the teams array and the number of top teams to select from each group
const topTeams = calculateKnockoutStage(teams, 5);

// topTeams will now contain an array of 25 / 5 = 5 top teams from each group
// which can be used to proceed with the knockout stage of the competition
console.log(topTeams); // example output: [ { name: "Team 1", points: 15, goalsFor: 20, goalsAgainst: 10 }, ... ]


````
again:
````

// assume we have an array of 25 teams, each with a name and number of points
const teams = [
  { name: "Team 1", points: 9 },
  { name: "Team 2", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 3", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 4", points: 3 },
  { name: "Team 5", points: 0 },
  { name: "Team 6", points: 9 },
  { name: "Team 7", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 8", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 9", points: 3 },
  { name: "Team 10", points: 0 },
  { name: "Team 11", points: 9 },
  { name: "Team 12", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 13", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 14", points: 3 },
  { name: "Team 15", points: 0 },
  { name: "Team 16", points: 9 },
  { name: "Team 17", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 18", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 19", points: 3 },
  { name: "Team 20", points: 0 },
  { name: "Team 21", points: 9 },
  { name: "Team 22", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 23", points: 6 },
  { name: "Team 24", points: 3 },
  { name: "Team 25", points: 0 }
];

// assume we want to advance the top 3 teams from each group to the knockout stage
const teamsPerGroup = 3;

// call the function to advance the top teams to the knockout stage
const knockoutTeams = advanceToKnockoutStage(teams, teamsPerGroup);

// print the resulting array of knockout teams
console.log(knockoutTeams);
`````

This will output an array of 15 knockout teams, consisting of the top 3 teams from each of the 5 groups, based on their number of points.

### v2

`````
function createKnockoutStage(teams) {
  // Sort teams by their ranking in their respective groups
  teams.sort((a, b) => b.groupRanking - a.groupRanking);

  // Determine the number of teams advancing from the group stage
  const numAdvancing = 5;

  // Create an array to hold the knockout stage matches
  const matches = [];

  // Create the knockout stage matches
  for (let i = 0; i < numAdvancing / 2; i++) {
    const team1 = teams[i];
    const team2 = teams[numAdvancing - i - 1];
    const match = {
      team1: team1,
      team2: team2,
      score: null,
      winner: null
    };
    matches.push(match);
  }

  // Return the knockout stage matches
  return matches;
}
`````
This function takes an array of teams as input and assumes that each team object has a groupRanking property indicating their ranking within their respective group. The function then sorts the teams by their group ranking and selects the top teams to advance to the knockout stage. The number of teams advancing is determined by the numAdvancing variable, which is set to 5 in this example.

The function then creates an array to hold the knockout stage matches and uses a loop to create the matches. Each match object has properties for the two teams playing, the score, and the winner. In this example, the winner is left as null and can be updated later when the match is played.

Finally, the function returns the array of knockout stage matches.

__TEST:__
write a Java script test function for the above function

`````
// Import necessary modules and functions
const { calculateKnockoutStage } = require('./padelFunctions');

// Define test data
const topTeams = [
  { team: 'Team A', points: 10, gamesWon: 3, gamesLost: 0 },
  { team: 'Team B', points: 9, gamesWon: 3, gamesLost: 1 },
  { team: 'Team C', points: 7, gamesWon: 2, gamesLost: 2 },
  { team: 'Team D', points: 6, gamesWon: 2, gamesLost: 2 },
  { team: 'Team E', points: 4, gamesWon: 1, gamesLost: 3 }
];

// Define expected result
const expected = [
  { team: 'Team A', position: 1 },
  { team: 'Team B', position: 2 },
  { team: 'Team C', position: 3 },
  { team: 'Team D', position: 4 },
  { team: 'Team E', position: 5 }
];

// Define test function

  const result = calculateKnockoutStage(topTeams);
  console.log('Expected:', expected);
  console.log('Result:', result);
  console.log('Test passed:', JSON.stringify(result) === JSON.stringify(expected));
}

// Call test function
testCalculateKnockoutStage();


`````

This test function creates an example dataset of top teams and expected result, calls the calculateKnockoutStage function with the example dataset, and compares the result with the expected result to determine if the function is working correctly.
